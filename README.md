# Greyatom IDE's FTP Tree View

This fork of [Tree View package](https://github.com/learn-co/learn-ide-tree) is used by the [Greyatom IDE](https://greyatom.com) to provide all of tree-view's functionality while synchronizing with a remote filesystem. It's intended to be used alongside the primary [Greyatom IDE package](https://github.com/greyatom-edu-tech/greyatom-ide).

## Methodology
For an understanding of how tree-view works, see [it's repo](https://github.com/atom/tree-view).
